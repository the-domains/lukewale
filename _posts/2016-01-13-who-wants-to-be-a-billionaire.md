Lottery company Lottoland is giving Australians the chance to enter the world's biggest ever lottery, the whopping $US1.5 billion ($2.15 billion) Powerball jackpot.

The Gibraltar-based betting company, which has offices in Sydney and Darwin, has been awarded a five-year license by the Northern Territory Racing Commission to[open online gambling in international lotteries][0].

The US Powerball draw takes place at 11am AWST on Thursday. West Australians can buy tickets for $10.50 each at[Lottoland.com.au][1]but are ineligible for a 'free ticket' offer.

Previously, players were required to travel to the lottery's country of origin to be able to play. "We are very excited about this, and Lottoland is setting the pace in opening up winning customer opportunities right around the world,"[Lottoland spokesman Luke Brill told Yahoo][2].

"It's quite incredible now to think Australian citizens through Lottoland can join in on the race to win a mega international lottery without having to leave the comfort of their own lounge room or office."
