## StarCraft 2

I've put many hours into the first two expansions of StarCraft 2\. It has been my go-to game for that well polished, fun & tense real time strategy fix that I crave from time to time. I can go months and play nothing but SC2 then leave it for a year and pick it up again just as quickly.
