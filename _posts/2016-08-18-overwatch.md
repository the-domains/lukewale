I play Overwatch on Xbox One. Reaper, Winston, 76, Ana... So many fun heros to play.

Recently I've been decimating people as Reaper but I like the fact that there are so many heros to choose from. Depending on my mood or what my team needs, I can change up heros and experience a completely different play style.
